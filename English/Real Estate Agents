Thank you for coming to the open house inspection.
Who here is from China?
Okay, everyone else piss off!
You have no hope!

Yeah, welcome, welcome, right this way.
Not you.
Why?
You don't have the money for this place!
Get outta here! You bum!

Yes, yes, you like?
[In Chinese:] Lots of shops nearby.
Not bad brothel, very close!

Hi, we'd like to sell your house.
No.
But we got two million for number 35 and with an effect...
Oh, please, ah!
Get off! You agent idiot!

Mate, would you like me to show you the garage?
No, look, I'm not interested.
Why?
There's not enough natural light, okay?
Natural light?
Your fucking head looks like a Zinger fillet, mate!
Your heads dried up like beef jerky!
No more natural light!

It looks small. But it feels big.
Well, if it feels big, isn't that all that matters?
I mean, does the real size even matter?
It could be bigger.
But can you handle that?
I mean you don't want it to hurt, do you?

We have the beautiful master bedroom, spacious and airy.
Is it good for sex?
What do you mean?
Can I use this room to try for sex?

Hi, ni hao, sorry, my house is not for sale.
But the sign says "for sale".
It's not real. Not real like Taiwan.
Get off my property!

Hi, are you interested in selling?
It's not my house.
I've got two very interested buyers.
Yeah, but it's not my house.
Okay, could you give this to your parents then for me?
They don't wanna sell! Now get off my property you skank!
You fucking rat!

We love this place. We'll make you an offer tonight!
But there's only one toilet. You gonna share?
You look like you shit like a cow!
What are you talking about? You can't put her through that.
No woman alive should ever share a toilet with you!

What is the asking price for the broom?
What?
I believe it will have good capital gain.
The broom's not for sale!
Can I rent it?

I just reallt don't like this lounge room.
"I really don't like this lounge room."
You'll be in the kitchen most of the time! Who cares?
Now you can put in an offer or get the fuck out of here!

Before you bid, we have a message from a neighbour.
Alright, listen up!
During weekdays, don't leave through William Street!
Alright! And after 9:00pm, any noise that you here,
it's just fireworks!

Lovely property, guys, who's gonna start us off?
$5!
The reserve is $800,000, guys.
$9! $3!

1.5.
1.5.
1.6.
Nup, invalid bid! Bid's invalid!
Why?
What do mean "why"? No Indian buyers!
[Speaking Hindi]

Gone! Sold to our bidder from Beijing for $80 billion!
$80 billion!
Is the chair negotiable?
Oh, would you get the hell outta here and let me do my job!
It really is a buyer's market, folks,
with buyers really starting to step it up in the first quarter.
Ah!
Arrgh!
