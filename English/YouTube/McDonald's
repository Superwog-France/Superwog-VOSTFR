Hi, do you have almond milk?
Nah, ran out.
What about oat milk?
All gone.
Okay, what about...
Look, we've only got milk that comes from a tit!
You happy with that or nah?

There you go, bro.
Hey, where's the second McChicken?
Dunno. Guess it ran away, huh?
Don't fucking throw it at me, you dog!
You're a McFlop!

Sorry, can I just add another cheesburger meal?
You again? Nah, not this time, love.
But I just walked in.
Yeah and you can walk into Coles
and buy some groceries like a normal mother.
Cook dinner, asshole!

You eat like that at home?
Huh? You animal.
Close your mouth when you eat, you fucking scumbag!
The cow on your burger had more manners than you!

Hey, fucking wake up!
Wake up, don't sleep here, bro, get outta here!
But I'm homeless.
Yeah and there's like a hundred free benches out there,
get outta here!

Excuse me.
Excuse me!
I've tried to visit the lavatory,
but there's a large shit on the floor!
Oh, I'm sorry about that, we'll fix it right now.
I'm loving it.
I'm loving the fucking floor turds guys, that's great!

I'll get the Fillet-o-Fish.
Oh, nah.
What?
They've been sitting there for like half an hour,
get something else, man.
No, that's fine, I'll get one.
You sure? They smell like my ass after F45.
Uh, Jesus.
Now fuck off, you big pig!

Hey, mate, what are you doing?
I have finished eating!
Mate, every weekend you come here and leave your rubbish.
You can't do that!
Every weekend, McDonald's leave rubbish on my lawn!
I am returning the favour!

Hey, do we really sponsor the Olympics?
Yeah.
Why don't we sponsor Westmead Hospital instead.
Most people that end up in there come in here first.

I ordered the strawberry milkshake, not vanilla.
We've only got vanilla.
I don't want vanilla, I want strawberry!
It's all the same, dickhead!
It's just different coloured mush!
It's just mush!

I had a look at your resume and it's not very impressive, mate.
Says here your last job was cleaning your uncle's pool once a month.
Mate, where's the reference? Gimme your uncle's number!

Can I have a large Happy Angus Vanilla Crispy Meal?
What?
And a Double Hash Angus Spicy Pounder Classic,
three Hash Nuggets with extra Coca-Cola?

Yeah, mate, I'm sitting opposite your pipsqueak nephew,
says he cleaned your pool once a month.
He do a got job or nah?
He fucked the pool pump?
Nah, bro, you're out! Try Hungry Jacks, bro!

Was the cow in this burger vaccinated or not?
I don't know.
What about the McChickens?
Did they recieve the booster shot?
I'll get two double-vaxxed McChickens, thanks!

What do you want?
Three Hash Nuggets with extra Coca-Cola!
Mate, we don't have any of that!
Okay, fine!
I will get a Classic Crispy McDonald Two-Piece Feed
Crispy Fanta Meal!

So, the McChicken is 400 calories,
if I order another small fries...
Are you seriously counting calories?
What? I don't wanna feel like shit!
Lady, everything here is designed to make you feel like death!
Up for 10 minutes, then death!

So wait, we use a clown to sell Happy Meals to kids?
Yeah.
So they can eat shit food?
And we put a little toy in there for them?
Yeah.
So we feed kids shit and give them toys,
so they keep eating more shit?

[Speaking Hindi]
No! Citizens only!

How many times do I tell you not to leave rubbish on my lawn?!
Mate, it's not us, it's the customers!
Really? Here!
Hey!
Ah!
McDonald's will never beat me!
