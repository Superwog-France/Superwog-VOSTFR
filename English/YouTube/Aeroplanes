Uh, yeah, good morning, this is your fucking captain speaking.
[Mumbled]
I'm gonna hook a right and then a left. Enjoy your flight!

Well, there's a reason why we're rated the best airline in Australia.
And that's because of our customer service.
We're gonna be your flight attendants!
Youse only get one snack!
One snack!
That's it!
You only get one!
Now, for your safety demonstration.
Alright, listen up!
You get one lifejacket! This is the only lifejacket we got!
And don't bother putting the oxygen masks on!
You're better off to pass out and feel your death!

Okay, sir, your on an exit row.
Are you willing and able to help in the event of an emergency.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not! You'll fucking block the exit!
Swap with that guy! Fucking homeless bellydance over.

Air traffic control,
we're gonna have to ask you to take it down 25,000 feet.
No can do, mate.
No, repeat.
I like the view of this altitude, bro.
Yeah, get down to 25,000 feet, mate.
Don't tell me what to do, mate.
Do it now, you got a plane coming right at you.

I don't wanna fucking hear about it.
Beef or chicken?
Is the chicken free-range?
You mean was like he walking?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, he was running, he was running free all his life.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, he had that much lifespan,
they starting renting to other chickens.
Free range? Get the fuck outta here.
You take what you get.
You don't get to ask me a million questions about a fucking chicken.
What a fucking idiot, bro!

Why don't you stay here a while?
I can't, I've gotta serve economy their meals.
When we leave, do you want me to give you a private tour of the plane?
Not really.
I'll show you my flaps, if you show me yours.
Muhahaha.
Get outta here, you're annoying me now!
Get out! Get outta here!
