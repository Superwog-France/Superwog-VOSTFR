Uh, yeah, good morning, this is your fucking captain speaking.
I'm gonna hook a right and then a left. Enjoy your flight!

Well, there's a reason why we're rated the best airline in Australia.
And that's because of our customer service.
We're gonna be your flight attendants!
Youse only get one snack!
One snack!
That's it!
You only get one!
Now, for your safety demonstration.
Alright, listen up!
You get one lifejacket! This is the only lifejacket we got!
And don't bother putting the oxygen masks on!
You're better off to pass out and feel your death!

Okay, sir, your on an exit row.
Are you willing and able to help in the event of an emergency.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not! You'll fucking block the exit!
Swap with that guy! Fucking homeless bellydance over.

Air traffic control,
we're gonna have to ask you to take it down 25,000 feet.
No can do, mate.
No, repeat.
I like the view of this altitude, bro.
Yeah, get down to 25,000 feet, mate.
Don't tell me what to do, mate.
Do it now, you got a plane coming right at you.

I don't wanna fucking hear about it.
Beef or chicken?
Is the chicken free-range?
You mean was like he walking?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, he was running, he was running free all his life.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, he had that much lifespan,
they starting renting to other chickens.
Free range? Get the fuck outta here.
You take what you get.
You don't get to ask me a million questions about a fucking chicken.
What a fucking idiot, bro!

Why don't you stay here a while?
I can't, I've gotta serve economy their meals.
When we leave, do you want me to give you a private tour of the plane?
Not really.
I'll show you my flaps, if you show me yours.
Muhahaha.
Get outta here, you're annoying me now!
Get out! Get outta here!

Can I get a Fanta please?
Fanta?
Yeah, Fanta.
Let me get my supervisor.
He wants a Fanta.
Don't ask for another one.

Yeah, mate, is this flight 2F225?
It is, go ahead.
Back off, huh! You've been on my ass since Vietnam!
I'm flying at an authorised level.
If you don't back off, I'm gonna pump my fuel on your windscreen, bro!

The good thing is, ever since he joined us,
there's been zero in-flight altercations.
Excuse me, can you please put your seat up?
Excuse me?
Hey! Fucking wake up! The lady's tryna eat behind you!
Put your seat up while your eating! You understand?
You fucking economy peasants!

On approach to landing, please confirm runway.
Runway ATR, Alpha Tango Romeo, please confirm.
Runway ATR, that's A for anal, T for testicle, R for rimjob.
Would you like me to confirm?
No thanks.

This is our first time in Thailand, have you got any suggestions?
Yeah, Pat Pong is good, rub you and suck you,
but some places they only rub, you not suck you.
Oh, I don't think so. We're more into arts and culture.
Oh, yeah, like shows?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, they got the Ping Pong Pussy Show,
they shoot ping pongs from their mics, I swear to God.
Okay, that's enough.
We'll be getting you some brochures.

Engine two's overheating!

So first I'm gonna do Europe, and then India
and them I'm gonna hitch-hike through South America!
Wow, some guy musta really fucked you over bad, huh?
You hitch-hiking South America? What's wrong with you?
They don't have buses there?

So I'm doing Barcelona and then I'm doing Prague.
Oh, Prague is amazing!
"Prague is amazing!", how would you know?
You went like once, bro, you're acting like you fucking live there!
Excuse me, I've been more than once.
Yeah, what, twice?
Twice for like two days? So what?

I wanna travel the world!
Why?
To experience the culture!
You want culture? Go to any car wash in Sydney for culture!

Why's it moving so much?
Bro, it's saying that we're 20 metres from the ground!
Pull up! Pull down to go up!
No, you pull up to go down!
I don't wanna be a fucking episode of Aircrash Investigations!
That's the manual, look at it! What's it say to do in storm?
It's says...
I forgot how to read!
I can't breathe!
Calm down! Calm down!
I can't breathe!
Bro, go get the parachutes, I got two of them,
we jump out and ditch the plane!
